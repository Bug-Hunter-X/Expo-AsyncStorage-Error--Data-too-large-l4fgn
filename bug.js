This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo. The problem is that AsyncStorage is not designed to store large amounts of data or complex objects directly.  Attempting to store large JSON objects can lead to errors like this.  The root cause is that AsyncStorage has limitations on the size of data it can handle, and exceeding these limits leads to failure.  Additionally, complex data structures might not serialize or deserialize reliably.
